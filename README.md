6. With everything else on my plate, it's hard to find time for the project. The bits of time I have put into it so far were used to look over the parts of the project I would be working with and a littel bit of tinkering. The current plan is to pick a chess variant to implement by Monday. If I'm lucky, I'll have the variant implemented within time. Otherwise, I'd have starting bits of it.
